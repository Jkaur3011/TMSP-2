                  While the Indian education system concentrates on loading as much information as possible in the minds of the students, it rarely enables the teachers to draw out their inherent potential. The change was needed to stop teachers from directing and feeding in answers in the minds of the learners; to bring about a paradigm shift by getting the teachers to become facilitators of knowledge; and to help the learners to extract solutions, question preset theories and be responsive and adaptable. Thus, a unique pedagogy had to be built to fulfill this vision and philosophy.

Another factor to be kept in mind is that children need to become equipped with 21st century skills, social and emotional skills while developing themselves in areas they have talent in. They need to be proficient in creative and critical thinking, analysis, reasoning, problem solving, synthesis, data handling, applying their learning, and presentation skills. They need the best pedagogic practices, the latest technological tools and liberation from the tyranny of rote learning.

At the end of the years of schooling, the confident and responsible person that needs to emerge out of the school system requires careful nurturing. Thus, the system needs to be given opportunities to build values unconsciously in the minds of the child so s/he becomes an asset to society and becomes a harbinger of progress.

              <p>
                  The curriculum in the Millennium Schools is powered by the Millennium Learning SystemTM. Every tangible for MLS has been developed at the Research and Development Division of Education Quality Foundation of India, with a focused outcome in mind. This outcome is clearly understood through our vision for every child who enters the system. Age appropriate, psychologically mapped and pedagogically apt tangibles are used at every level of the Millennium Learning System. Some of these are the books, the assessment system and the lesson plans.

                  The personalized dictionary, concept books, project books, follow up journals, apprentice manuals, explorer’s quest and portfolios are all designed to help in the process of building relevant skills. Learners’ creativity, data handling skills and presentation skills are automatically built along with social and emotional skills as they learn through collaboration and peer interaction.

                  Suitable support and training ensures that the facilitators are empowered to create a motivating atmosphere. The classrooms become vibrant with the process of teaching-learning. The overall effect is not just a passive transfer of information, but lively, interactive and enjoyable sessions where the learners develop confidence and build skills as they understand and apply the knowledge by connecting it to their daily life.

                  Assessments are a very important part of the curriculum of the Millennium Learning system. It aids to bring up the skill levels of each learner. A system of regular Formative Assessments and Summative Assessments help achieve this.
